# Huffman-ASCII-Compression
Implementing Huffman Coding to compress and decompress ASCII text files.

This was a project for my <i>Design of Algorithms</i> course, presented by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7IWqCdsAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. M. Naghibzadeh</a> at the Computer Science Department of Ferdowsi University.

<h3>How to run the code?</h3>

1. You can specify the input file path using <code>Directory</code> variable at the beginnign of the code. There are a few test files in the <code>./test_files</code> directory too !

2. Under the <code>Directory</code> variable, you can specify the output path for the binary/compressed file.


3. After providing the right path in the code you can run it and compare the size of your text file to compressed file.

Here is the comparison for <code>tolstoy.txt</code> test file:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src=""
    </td>
    <td>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
